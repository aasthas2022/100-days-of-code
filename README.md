# 100DaysOfCode - Aastha Shukla

## Day 1 :

As I embark on my journey of #100DaysOfCode, I began by acquainting myself with AWS IAM Roles. Alongside, I've started tackling some of the easier LeetCode problems, setting the stage for a gradual and systematic understanding of various coding concepts and practices. Today's dive involved problem-solving in both JavaScript and SQL, promising an enriching learning journey ahead.

### JavaScript Solutions

- **[Return Length of Arguments Passed (LeetCode 2703)](https://leetcode.com/problems/return-length-of-arguments-passed/)**: This problem is a good starter to understand JavaScript's ability to manage variable numbers of arguments. The solution involved the creation and testing of the `argumentsLength` function with different argument sets.

- **[Concatenation of Array (LeetCode 1929)](https://leetcode.com/problems/concatenation-of-array/)**: A beginner-friendly problem, I tackled this with three distinct approaches for array concatenation - utilizing spread syntax, the `concat` function, and `push()`. This served as an excellent opportunity to get comfortable with basic array manipulations in JavaScript.

## SQL Learning

- **[Recyclable and Low Fat Products (LeetCode 1757)](https://leetcode.com/problems/recyclable-and-low-fat-products/)**: This SQL task helped me understand how to query data based on specific conditions (`low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y'`). It also opened the door to understanding why SQL opts for a single equals sign (=) for equality.
